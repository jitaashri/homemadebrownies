<p>This is the recipe of how to make homemade brownies.</p>

<p>Ingredients:
    Butter ‚Äì It‚Äôs best to use salted butter as the recipe does not call for additional salt. You can always add salt to your preference. I know lots of people like sea salt on top of their brownies and that would work just fine. But for the recipe, use salted butter to help with the flavor and for contrast to the sweetness. 

    Granulated Sugar ‚Äì Yes I know it‚Äôs 2 entire cups of sugar. But as long as one person does not eat the entire pan I think it will be okay üôÇ If you want to, go ahead and experiment with using less sugar. I‚Äôve never done it so I can‚Äôt even say for sure where to start. Remember that the cocoa powder is unsweetened so you do need the sugar in the recipe to avoid a really bitter taste. 
    
    Cocoa Powder ‚Äì Be sure you are using unsweetened cocoa powder. They do make a dark chocolate cocoa powder that you can use in this recipe as well. I‚Äôve never done it, but if dark chocolate is your thing then try using that. 
    
    Large Eggs ‚Äì 4 eggs is the correct amount. I get questions all the time about ‚Äúis it really 4 eggs?‚Äù Yes it is. Seems like a lot but the eggs provide so much moisture and texture to the brownies. I love a soft, cake-like, semi fudgy brownie and 4 eggs will help with that. It‚Äôs also important how you mix the eggs into the batter. More on that below. 
    
    
    Vanilla Extract ‚Äì I always buy the pure vanilla extract. Yes it is expensive (which kills me when I buy it) but the flavor you get from pure vanilla extract is worth it. Yes you can use imitation vanilla extract but for the best taste, stick to the pure stuff. 
    
    All-Purpose Flour ‚Äì I always buy unbleached all-purpose flour but any type can be used. Bleached flour, gluten-free flour, just whatever you prefer or whatever you have in your kitchen. I would avoid whole wheat flour as that makes baked goods very dense and dry.

<p>Recipe:
    HOW TO MAKE HOMEMADE BROWNIES
    Everything gets mixed up into one bowl and no hand mixer or KitchenAid is needed. It‚Äôs very important to follow the recipe steps. I know it‚Äôs way easier to just mix all the wet stuff together and then add the dry ingredients, but it‚Äôs written the way it is for a reason. 
    
    Stir together the melted butter and granulated sugar. This step is important because the key to a perfect brownie is to combine the sugar and the eggs separately. So make sure you really combine the sugar and butter well. 
    Add in 4 eggs, one at a time, stirring the egg in completely before adding the next egg. This is so important. Each egg needs to be fully incorporated into the batter before adding the next. It provides volume to the brownie batter and makes perfect brownies each time. If you love chewy, soft cake-like, and fudgy brownies then the secret is in the eggs.
    Add the vanilla extract and unsweetened cocoa powder and mix well. Add the flour in and use a spatula to gently stir it into the batter just until everything is combined and no flour pocket/streaks remain in the batter. 
    Pour the batter into the pan and spread out evenly. It is a thick batter so I recommend dropping large spoonful‚Äôs (I use a large cookie scoop to do this) all over the baking dish and then spreading it out. This makes it easier to spread a thick batter rather than one large pile of batter in the middle of the pan.
    You can top the brownie batter (BEFORE baking) with sprinkles, chocolate chips, peanut butter, chips, dark chocolate chips, mini m&m‚Äôs. We always end up topping ours with chocolate sprinkles or mini m&m‚Äôs.
